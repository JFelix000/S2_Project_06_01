/* HTML Styles */
/* The HTML can have the fixed property after it so that it can make the scroll not move the image. This is good when the image only looks good for the whole size of the computer and not to be stretched. */

    background: url(sd_back1.png) fixed;
    background-size: 100%;
}

/* Body Styles */
/* i had to first select the image and then use background image to make the radial gradient with closest corner AT those dimensions. I separated position and the colors, when I made sure to not have syntax errors because that was not letting it work for the longest. When I had to do this at home I just researched it so it can make it affect the stuff I wanted to. */
